## About Me 🚀

I'm a passionate Sr. Analyst Infrastructure Services with experience in Mainframe technology. I love tackling complex problems, learning new skills, and collaborating with diverse teams to create innovative solutions.

- 🌱 Currently learning: OCI AI foundations associate 2025
- 🔭 Working on: Python project using ML
- 🌍 Languages: Python, COBOL, JCL, REXX. And I speak in English
- 📫 How to reach me: Kiranjadi404@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: 🧠 COBOL is so deeply embedded in global infrastructure that over 90% of ATM transactions still rely on it today. That means every time someone grabs cash, there's a good chance kind of code is behind the scenes making it happen!

## Featured Projects 💻

- Project name : Python for Machine learning 
- B# 🧠 Deep Learning Classification with Multilayer Perceptron

A deep learning project that demonstrates how to build and train a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** for classification tasks using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores the use of a fully connected neural network (MLP) to classify data into distinct categories. It walks through data preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, depending on your implementation)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ✨ Features

- Clean and modular code structure  
- Configurable MLP architecture (layers, activation functions, etc.)  
- Training and validation performance tracking  
- Confusion matrix and classification report  
- Support for custom datasets

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-mlp-classification.git
cd deep-learning-mlp-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Usage
python train.py --dataset data.csv --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
Or modify the Jupyter notebook MLP_Classifier.ipynb to experiment interactively.


## 🖼️ Sample Output
Confusion Matrix
Confusion matrix showing classification performance.


## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC (optional)


## 📄 License
